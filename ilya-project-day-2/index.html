		<h1>Ilya Methot Me</h1>
		<h3>I walked into a bus tunnel and heard the entire space GROWL</h3>
		<p>I’ve read that haunted places are filled with low frequencies that bounce off the walls until they are only felt by the body. The roar of a lion also contains this low rumbling sound. The lack of sound can itself be a sound.</p>
		<h3>Some sounds I like:</h3>
		<p>Wind blowing through the side of the city that goes unnoticed The clink of silverware in a fancy restaurant An apple falling from a tree and hitting a ground covered in leaves The scream of a truck engine A singing guitar</p>
		<h4>I take classes at Emerson College where I study Visual Media Arts.</h4>
		<p>There I hope to find projects to apply different sounds in different forms of media: Film Web Design Art Movement My favorite thing is to walk around with a shotgun microphone and headphones. It picks up a lot of cool individual sounds you wouldn’t have noticed otherwise. There was an air conditioner down some stairs that sounded like wind on mountains. I am currently making a program that reads hand movements and translates them into sound using the XBox Kinect.</p>
